* Summary
These scripts will connect to the Freshdesk APIs using Python 3. Some of the planned features are:
  - Get all open tickets and insert into a database
  - Get all new_and_my_open tickets
  - Search for tickets containing a specific tag
  - Get all overdue tickets
  - Get all unresolved tickets
  - Get all tickets I'm watching
  - Get all tickets I've requested

This is in part an exercise for me to practice some of the things I'm learning
in Python; but also to be used for some things I want to do at work. That being
said, I'll be happy to add features that someone would like to have that I may
not have thought of. Disclaimer: I don't make any promises on when those
features might be added.
